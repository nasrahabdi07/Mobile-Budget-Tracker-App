# Mobile Budget Tracker 

A comprehensive, full-stack expense tracking application built with **React Native (Expo)** and **Firebase**.

I designed this app to help users track their finances efficiently, featuring detailed analytics, real-time synchronization, and an intelligent receipt scanner.

##  Features

-   **Dashboard Analytics**: Interactive charts and time-based filtering (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) to visualize spending habits.
-   **Smart Receipt Scanner**: Integrated camera functionality that uses the **Gemini Vision API** to automatically extract merchant details and prices from physical receipts.
-   **Real-time Persistence**: Authentication and database operations are powered by **Firebase**, ensuring data is synced instantly across devices.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Full capability to Add, Edit, and Delete transactions with a polished UI.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Robust email/password login system.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript
-   **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
-   **Visualization**: React Native Chart Kit
